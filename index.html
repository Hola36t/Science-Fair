<h1 style="border:2px solid Navy;">Rocket Launch off</h1>

<h2 style = "border:2px solid Darkorange"><u>Introduction</u></h2>

<p>Chandryaan - 3 is the 3rd rocket sent by the ISRO(Indian space research organisation)after the 2 failed attempts of reaching the southern
hemisphere of the Moon being an LVM3 rocket with the virkram lander and pragyan rover.<br>It was launched off at 14:35 IST 14th July 2023, landed on the moon August 23rd and returned to Earth at 14:42 November 
15th.<br>It Launched of Sriharikota,Andrha Pradesh and landed on the moon at the coordinates of 69.36 S and 32.34 E.moon(About 600 km from the south pole of the moon).<br>
This makes it the first rocket to reach the south pole of the moon which is now one India's Greatest Achivements.</p>

<p style = "border:2px solid White"><b><u>Why was it such a great achivement you ask?</u></b><br> With the success of Chandryaan - 3 Chandrayaan-3's landing site is also closer to the moon's south pole than any other 
spacecraft in history has ventured. The South Pole region is considered an area of key scientific and strategic interest for spacefaring nations, 
as scientists believe the region to be home to water ice deposits, it said.It also found other elements like sulphur(S),Oxygen(O2),Aluminium(Al) and Calcium(Ca),these findings can create the hypothesis that water is located on the lunar south pole.<br>They, also found that at the surface of the lunar south pole it is 50°C while 80 mm deeper it measures -10°C making a 60°C difference.<br> This is a new discovery for all and the books!</p>

<h2 style = "border:2px solid DodgerBlue"><u>How do rockets launch off</u></h2>

<p>In the case of rockets, the action is the force produced by the expulsion of gas, smoke, and flames from the nozzle end of a rocket engine.<br> The reaction force propels the rocket in the opposite direction.<br> When a rocket lifts off, the combustion products from the burning propellants(propellants are materials that spews out of the back of the spacecraft giving it thrust, or a push forward. Often the propellant is a kind of fuel which is burned with an oxidizer to produce large volumes of very hot gas. These gasses expand until they rush out of the back of the rocket, making thrust.) accelerate rapidly out of the engine.</p>

<h2 style = "border:2px solid Limegreen"><u>What are the parts of a rocket?</u></h2>

<img src="https://slidingmotion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Parts-of-a-Rocket-Names-Functions-Diagram.jpg" alt = "systems and Parts of a rocket" align="right" width="300" height="300">

<p>The Parts of the rocket with different systems can be divided into:<br>
•The Nose cone<br>
Contains:-The Payload system<br>
the conically shaped forwardmost section of a rocket, guided missile or aircraft,<br>designed to modulate oncoming airflow behaviors and minimize aerodynamic drag.<br>Also, containing the Payload system - deals with not only the specific radio technologies and systems aboard a spacecraft tasked with delivering mission objectives, but also the supporting ground equipment <br>and telecommunication systems through which spacecraft payloads are controlled and results communicated to mission control.<br>
•The rocket body.<br>
Contains:-The Fuel,Propulsion system, the Guidance System & the Oxidizer<br>
The body of a rocket is not one of the more influential parts.<br> The purpose of the body is to house the fuel.<br> It is often in the form of a hollow cylinder because it reduces the amount surface area that is in contact with the air.<br> This in turn reduces drag.<br>Liquid oxygen (LOX) serves as the oxidizer.<br> The boosters, on the other hand, use aluminum as fuel with ammonium perchlorate as the oxidizer, mixed with a binder that creates one homogenous solid propellant.<br> Hydrogen, the fuel for the main engines, is the lightest element and normally exists as a gas.<br>The Propulstion system;the force used by the rocket to take off from the ground. It is based on Newton's third law of motion principle.<br> Liquid fuel, solid fuel, cold gas and ion are the types of rocket propulsion.<br> Acceleration depends on the exhaust velocity, burning of the fuel, and mass of the rocket.<br>Guidance System | Glenn Research Center | NASA
The guidance system of a rocket includes very sophisticated sensors, on-board computers, radars, and communication equipment.<br> The guidance system has two main roles during the launch of a rocket; to provide stability for the rocket, and to control the rocket during maneuvers.<br>
•The Fins.<br>
Contains:- The combustion chamber fuel and Oxidizer Pump, Nozzle<br>
The Fins flap and make the rocket go farther. they help keep the rocket stable during flight.A combustion chamber fuel is the area within the Cylinder where the fuel/air mix is ignited.<br> As the Piston compresses the fuel/air mix and makes contact with the Spark Plug, the mixture is combusted and pushed out of the Combustion Chamber in the form of energy.<br>The oxidizer pump Pumps carry the fuel and oxidizer.<br> The combustion chamber mixes and burns the two liquids.<br> The gas put off by the reaction passes through the "throat", which aligns all the gases produced in the right direction.<br> The nozzle is  a propelling nozzle (usually of the de Laval type) used in a rocket engine to expand and accelerate combustion products to high supersonic velocities.

<h2 style = "border:2px solid Tomato">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In Conclusion,Chandryaan - 3 acheived one of India's greatest Acheviment by landing on the south pole of the moon<br>Rockets launch off the expulsion of gas, smoke, and flames from the nozzle.<br>The rocket can be divided into 3 different sections, The nose cone,The body and The fins of a rocket.</p>
